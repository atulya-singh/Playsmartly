### Playsmartly is a platform for young sports enthusiasts to keep their dream alive and not letting financial hurdles stop them from making the team. Because everyone who works hard and plays smart deserves that chance.

This website will allow users to:
- Sell their own sports gear for sale
-  Donate their gear if they grow out of it (or decide to move to anther sport) and keep the community alive
-   Purchase sports gear directly on our site

This project is projected to launch by June 2024 and currently the front-end demo can be found here:
